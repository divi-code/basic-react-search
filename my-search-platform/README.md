A basic search platform

Develop a simple database that you can add, read, update, and delete from. This database will serve as your search database. So it means that anytime you search, you are to return the search result from the database. The search results you return must match the search query.

Tasks:

Ability to add to the search database
Ability to update the search database
Return an empty message if there is no search result.

Features:

A search input for the search query.
A panel to add to the database
A panel to update the database
A panel to show the search results.

NOTE:

Include a detailed README that explains how to use the search platform
Using TypeScript or React.JS is a plus
